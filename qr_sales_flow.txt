 SALES ORDERING SYSTEM: A QR Code-Based Sales and Ordering Management Solution for Harah Rubina Del Dios
Technologies and Approach:
Modular Method

PHP (Backend logic)

MySQL (Database)

Bootstrap (Frontend responsiveness)

WebSockets (PHP Ratchet) for real-time updates

Web-based Interfaces for all users (No mobile apps required)

User Roles:
Customer: Web-based interface mobile responsive  

Cashier: Web-based interface realtime websocket 

Kitchen Staff: flutter, but mobile/tablet-responsive

Waiter: flutter, mobile-responsive

Admin: Web-based interface

System Flow:
Customer Interaction:
Customer scans the QR code on their table using a mobile device.

The QR code redirects them to a web-based menu where they can:

Browse available food and drinks

Select items and quantities

Submit their order

Order Processing:
The submitted order is recorded in the system and sent to:

Cashier’s system (for billing)

Kitchen panel (for food preparation, status: pending)

The cashier reviews the order, confirms payment method (via dropdown for Cash or GCash), and marks the order as PAID.

WebSockets immediately notify the kitchen that the order is confirmed.

Kitchen Workflow:
The kitchen staff (using a flutter, mobile-responsive interface) receives the confirmed order and starts preparing the food.

Once the food is ready, the kitchen staff marks the order as COMPLETED.

WebSockets trigger a real-time notification to the waiter’s device that the order is ready.

Serving the Customer:
The waiter receives the notification that the order is ready and delivers the food to the customer’s table.

The waiter marks the order as DELIVERED in the system to indicate that the food has been served.

Post-Meal Process & Table Management:
After the customer finishes eating, the waiter checks the table, cleans it, and marks it as EMPTY in the system.

The system updates the table status to AVAILABLE for new customers.

Additional Features:
Real-time communication between all users via PHP Ratchet WebSockets for order updates and notifications.

Bootstrap ensures mobile responsiveness for both kitchen staff and waiters.

Modular approach for easy maintenance and scaling.

Table Management: Tracks table status (Occupied, Available, Empty).

Order Queueing System: Orders are managed based on priority and timing.

Admin Interface: Manage users, products, reports, and system settings.
